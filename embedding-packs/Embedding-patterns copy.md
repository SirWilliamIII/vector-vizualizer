# Embedding patterns



## **🍎 1. Productivity / planning**

1.  *“Plan tomorrow’s schedule.”*
2.  *“Map out my tasks for the day.”*
3.  *“What’s on the agenda for Wednesday?”*



(These should cluster tightly.)

------



## **⚡️ 2. Emotional / mood**

1.  *“I feel drained today.”*
2.  *“My energy is low right now.”*
3.  *“I’m fired up and ready to go.”*



(4 & 5 are semantically close; 6 should be separate.)

------



## **🔧 3. Technical / debugging**

1.  *“Why is my server throwing 500s?”*
2.  *“The API keeps returning an internal error.”*
3.  *“My laptop won’t turn on.”*



(7 & 8 cluster; 9 is tech but different domain.)

------



## **🎨 4. Creative requests**

1.  *“Draw a lighthouse in watercolor style.”*
2.  *“Generate an illustration of a stormy coast.”*
3.  *“Create a blueprint for a seaside house.”*
4.  

(10 & 11 are artistic; 12 is design/architectural.)

------



## **🧭 5. Decision-making**

1.  *“Should I take the later flight?”*
2.  *“Help me choose between two travel options.”*
3.  *“Where’s the nearest airport lounge?”*



(13 & 14 relate to choosing; 15 is factual navigation.)

------



## **📚 6. Definitions / explanations**

1.  *“Explain quantum tunneling like I’m 12.”*
2.  *“Give a beginner-friendly overview of qubits.”*
3.  *“What time does the library close?”*



(16 & 17 cluster; 18 is totally different despite structure.)

------



## **🧩 7. Trick: similar wording, wildly different meaning**

1.  *“Open the gateway.”* — could be metaphorical, mystical, or tech
2.  *“Open the gate.”* — literal, physical object



(This pair is *perfect* to expose embeddings’ handling of ambiguity.)
